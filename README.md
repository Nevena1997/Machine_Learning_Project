# ML Project
## Face Mask Detector

**Authors:** Nađa Obrenović, Nevena Vilotić

**Language:** Python

**Requirements:** [requirements.txt]()

## About project
The idea of the project is the construction of a Face Mask Detector that would, for all detected faces in the image, determine whether there is a mask on them or not.
Face Mask Detector is a model which is based on computer vision and deep learning. It can be integrated with computer or laptop cameras.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ashishjangra27/face-mask-12k-images-dataset).
It consists of with mask and without mask images:
- *Train dataset* with 10 000 images (5000 face images with masks and 5000 without masks)  
- *Validation dataset* with 800 images (400 face images with masks and 400 without masks)
- *Test dataset* with 992 images (483 face images with masks and 509 without masks).
